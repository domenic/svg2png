# SVG-to-PNG Converter Using PhantomJS

You have a SVG file. For whatever reason, you need a PNG. **svg2png** can help.

```js
svg2png("source.svg", "dest.png", function (err) {
    // PNGs for everyone!
});
```

Maybe you need to scale the image while converting? We can do that too:

```js
svg2png("source.svg", "dest.png", 1.2, function (err) {
    // 1.2×-sized PNGs for everyone!
});
```

The scale factor is relative to the SVG's `viewbox` or `width`/`height` attributes, for the record.

To convert all svg files in a specified directory you may also use the CLI

``` 
svg2png directory
```

svg2png is built on the latest in [PhantomJS][] technology to render your SVGs using a headless WebKit instance. I have
found this to produce much more accurate renderings than other solutions like GraphicsMagick or Inkscape. Plus, it's
easy to install cross-platform due to the excellent [phantomjs][package] npm package—you don't even need to have
PhantomJS in your `PATH`.
